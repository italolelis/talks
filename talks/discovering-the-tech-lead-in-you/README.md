# Discovering the tech lead in you

## Summary
When you transition from a developer role to a tech lead, you realize how lonely it is, predominantly if you work in a smaller company. 
Your responsibilities and accountability grow, and when you have questions, you don't have many people to look out for when in need of help. What exactly being a tech lead means? What are the problems that you will have to solve in this role? How can you get better at it?
In this talk, I'd like to share that experience with you and hopefully shed some light on this new journey you are going through (even if you already are a tech lead).

## Abstract

When you transition from a developer role to a tech lead, you realize how lonely it is, predominantly if you work in a smaller company. 
Your responsibilities and accountability grow, and when you have questions, you don't have many people to look out for when in need of help. If you work in a larger company, you are lucky and can rely upon other tech leads to help and teach you what to do.

I've been through the process of becoming a tech lead a few years ago, and there were a lot of different challenges that I had to learn and overcome to deliver on my expectations. I can say it was tough but at the same time the best experience I had. 

Today, I manage multiple tech leads and understand their pain in transitioning from executioner to enabler. Understing your role will be the key to succeeding.

In this talk, I'd like to share that experience with you and hopefully shed some light on this new journey you are going through (even if you already are a tech lead).
