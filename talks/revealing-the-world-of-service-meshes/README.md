# Revealing the world of service meshes

## Summary

Service mesh technologies have gained a lot of interest over the past years. Although the concept of a service mesh might not be new to people, some of the implementation details are. In this talk I want to explore the ups and downs of using a service mesh and how can you start using one.

## Abstract

Software engineering is a constantly changing world. We went from monoliths to SOA to microservices and now lambda. We started simple, 5 services, then 10 services, a 100 and now we see companies with 2000+ services. Service mesh technologies have gained a lot of interest over the past years. High-traffic companies started to add a service mesh to their production applications. 
But what is a service mesh, exactly? And why is it relevant to you?

In this talk I want to explore the ups and downs of using a service mesh. My goal is to make sure you are well informed to make a smart decision if you want/need to use a service mesh.

## Outline

In all the steps, Iâ€™ll show some Go, Kubernetes and Istio code.
