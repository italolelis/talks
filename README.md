# Talks

This repository holds all the abstracts, templates and slides of my talks. I use [Deckset](http://deckset.com)
to build my presentations. Feel free to fork this repo and modify it if you'd like.

## Images

All images that are not mine are from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) and are credited on the presentations. Logos are taken from the official websites assets and credited as necessary.

Images that contain code, dashboards, traces, or any kind of aditional information are screenshots of my own. If yout want to use them please just credit it properly.
