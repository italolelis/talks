Iâ€™m a Brazilian living in Berlin, Germany. Currently working as Engineering Manager @N26. In the past I worked at HelloFresh mostly doing things in go.
I really like designing software and solving complex problems and go has been my language of choice since 2014. Today I spend most of my free time contributing to Open Source projects and writing some of my own.
