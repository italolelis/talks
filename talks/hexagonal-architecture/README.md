# Building hexagonal architecture Go applications

## Summary

Have you ever find yourself thinking about how you should structure your code? And what kind of architecture should you follow?
I'd like to bring you the `hexagonal` architecture in Go, showing how we can make projects more maintainable, testable and easy to understand.

## Abstract

Have you ever find yourself thinking about how you should structure your code? And what kind of architecture should you follow? If you come from object-oriented languages normally you will choose some classic model like MVC or Layred. In Go we normally use a flat file architecture and try to structure in a logical way, following the idiomatic Go.
What if there is something that will encourage you replicate your company's domain, gain more maintainability and it's easier to test?
I'd like to bring you the `hexagonal` architecture in Go, showing how we can make projects more maintainable, testable and easy to understand.

## Outline

In all of the steps Iâ€™ll show some Go, Kubernetes or Istio code on how these
patterns can be applied.
