# From cost to impact: Leading through infrastructure investment decisions

## Summary

This session explores tools like SLOs, KPI Trees, and the FinOps culture to make cost management a shared responsibility across the organization.

## Abstract

Many organizations face the challenge of delivering more with limited budgets, while also meeting the increasing demands of their customers for innovative products and improved service.

For engineering leaders, this means carefully prioritizing engineering work and investments in technical projects, while also considering the need to develop new technologies. However, choosing which engineering work to prioritize involves making effective budgetary tradeoffs and identifying the most impactful investments for the business. 

This session will explore practical tools such as SLOs, KPI Trees, and the FinOps culture to make cost management a shared responsibility across the organization. It will also focus on influencing without direct authority, driving transparency, and integrating cost optimization into the engineering culture. 

During this talk, participants will learn how to:

* Connect infrastructure investments to business success using actionable frameworks
* Enhance cost awareness and accountability within your teams
* Influence key stakeholders to align on strategic cost decisions.
