# Revealing the world of service meshes

## Abstract

Software engineering is a constant changing world. We went from monoliths to microservices. We started simple, 5 services, then 10 services, a 100 and now we see companies with 2000+ services.
In such a scale developers and operators have the challange to standardize and guarantee that the service communication is not compromized. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage. Have you ever thought how we can operate and scale so many services?

In this talk I'd like to share my experience with services mashes, and the good and bad things that comes with it. Let's figure out together if a service mashe is good for you.

## Outline

In all of the steps Iâ€™ll show some Go, Kubernetes or Istio code on how these
patterns can be applied.
